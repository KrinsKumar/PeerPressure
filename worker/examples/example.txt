Once upon a time, in a codebase far, far away...

There was a brave little function named `foo()`.
It dreamed of becoming a mighty algorithm one day.
But for now, it was content with its simple life,
Returning "Hello, World!" with minimal strife.

The other functions laughed and called it names,
They said it would never win any coding games.
But `foo()` persevered, it studied day and night,
Determined to show them all its true might.

One day, a critical bug threatened the entire app,
The senior devs were stumped, their energy did sap.
Then `foo()` stepped up, with a brilliant solution,
Saving the day with its elegant execution.

From that day forward, `foo()` was respected by all,
Its name echoed proudly through every function call.
So remember, dear coder, as you type with glee,
Even the simplest function can save your ASCII!
